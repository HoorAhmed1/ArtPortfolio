# ðŸ“¸ How to Add Your Images - Quick Guide

## Step 1: Prepare Your Images

### For Drawings (8 images):
1. Rename your drawing files to:
   - `drawing1.jpg` (or .png, .webp)
   - `drawing2.jpg`
   - `drawing3.jpg`
   - `drawing4.jpg`
   - `drawing5.jpg`
   - `drawing6.jpg`
   - `drawing7.jpg`
   - `drawing8.jpg`

2. Copy them to: `public\images\drawings\`

### For Bookmarks (5 images):
1. Rename your bookmark files to:
   - `bookmark1.jpg` (or .png, .webp)
   - `bookmark2.jpg`
   - `bookmark3.jpg`
   - `bookmark4.jpg`
   - `bookmark5.jpg`

2. Copy them to: `public\images\bookmarks\`

## Step 2: The HTML Will Automatically Show Your Images!

The portfolio is set up to automatically display:
- `drawing1.jpg` in the first drawing slot
- `drawing2.jpg` in the second drawing slot
- etc.

If an image doesn't exist, it will show a colorful placeholder instead.

## Step 3: Refresh Your Browser

After adding images, refresh your browser (press F5) to see them!

## Supported Image Formats:
- âœ… .jpg / .jpeg
